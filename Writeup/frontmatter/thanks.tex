% the acknowledgments section

I dedicate my gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Susan Murphy.  Without her kindness, I would not have had the opportunity to work with this project, and without her vision, I would not have been able to overcome the gaps I could not see.

I am furthermore deeply indebted to my lab advisors, Peng Liao and Kristjan Greenewald.  Thank you both for your immense patience for answering my incessant lines of questioning.

Finally, I thank my blinkmates for their endless care.  If not for the streams of encouragement, their constant source of happiness, or the numerous late-night but fruitful work sessions accompanied by Eliza, I would not have had the courage to finish this endeavor.
